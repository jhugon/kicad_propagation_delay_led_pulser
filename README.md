# Propagation Delay LED Pulser Board in KiCAD

This KiCad board pulses an LED with a very short pulse. The pulse width is
defined by the propagation delay of 3 inverters.

## Changelog

- v1.0 Difficult to hand-solder due to heat loss to ground plane (too many vias) and reversed 0612 capacitors
- v1.1 Remove extra vias and switch from 0612 to 1206 coupling caps
